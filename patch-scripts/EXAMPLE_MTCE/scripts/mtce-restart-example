# This script provides an example in-service patching restart for all maintenance processes

# The patching subsystem provides a patch-functions bash source file
# with useful function and variable definitions.

# We can now check to see what type of node we're on, if it's locked, etc,
# and act accordingly

# NOTE: The following restart example code could be implemented in scripts
# owned by the various domains, with a single high-level call in the patch-script.
# This would be the preferred method, in fact, to ensure the patch-scripts
# themselves are simple and clean.
